# `copilot-bootstrap` Image

This image is used as a very light placeholder when deploying DBT Platform infrastructure. It allows us to get the infrastructure into a decent position before we start involving application code and all the variables that adds.

As it will almost never change, there is no automated build and publish at present, these are manual steps.

The image is published to `public.ecr.aws/uktrade/copilot-bootstrap:latest` in the `Tools` AWS account.
