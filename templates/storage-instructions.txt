>>> Instructions

To provision the services in an environment run:

copilot env deploy

If you have added an s3 bucket, or an s3-policy, you will also need to deploy each service in each environment for that service to be able to access the s3 bucket.

copilot svc deploy --name {services} --env {env}

You will then be able to access the bucket directly from your service without additional authentication. 

>>> Credentials
{%- for service in services %}
{%- if service.storage_type in ["redis", "opensearch", "postgres"] %}
Add the following to your service's manifest.yml file to access {{ service.name }}:

secrets: 
{%- if service.storage_type == "redis" %}
  REDIS_ENDPOINT: /copilot/${COPILOT_APPLICATION_NAME}/${COPILOT_ENVIRONMENT_NAME}/secrets/{{ service.secret_name }}
{%- elif service.storage_type == "opensearch" %}
  OPENSEARCH_URL: /copilot/${COPILOT_APPLICATION_NAME}/${COPILOT_ENVIRONMENT_NAME}/secrets/{{ service.secret_name }}
{%- elif service.storage_type == "postgres" %}
  DATABASE_CREDENTIALS: 
    secretsmanager: ${COPILOT_APPLICATION_NAME}/${COPILOT_ENVIRONMENT_NAME}/{{ service.secret_name }}
{%- endif -%}

{%- endif %}
{% endfor -%}
